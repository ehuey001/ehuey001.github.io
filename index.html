  <h2>Hello everyone, my name is Eric Huey, I have a diverse background in music (jazz/Traditional Chinese orchestral/electronic),
    a Bachelors of Science degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing, and now I am pursuing a data analytics
    certification with UC Berkeley's Extension Center.

    In a casual setting, I love Super Smash Brothers (currently playing Ultimate), cocktail mixing, reading Manga/watching Anime.
    Some of my gaming history includes Pokemon, Starcraft 2, and League of Legends. Delving into a game and exploring advanced concepts
    is a frequent behavior of mine; it works out since I compete and sometimes win tournaments.
